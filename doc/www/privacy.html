<p>The Rabbit Escape game and web site do not collect any information about you.</p>
<p>If you buy Rabbit Escape through a store such as the Google Play Store, the store will collect information such as payment details and your address.  In some cases I may have access to this information through e.g. the Google Play Store Developer Console.  I will only use this information to contact you if you have trouble using or installing Rabbit Escape.  I will not use it for any marketing activitity.  I will not sell it or give it to anyone else.</p>
<p>If I have to report someone for abusive behaviour, I may pass on some of their details to a store or web site so they can be identified.  This would only happen if I had been unable to resolve any dispute amicably, and I or someone else was being attacked or abused by this person.</p>
